# H!NT Lab

## About Us

**H!NT Lab** (Human-Intelligence iNTegration Lab) is led by Dr. Hao Wang at the School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, China. The lab focuses on exploring cutting-edge technologies for the deep integration of human intelligence and machine intelligence, dedicated to building more natural, efficient, and intelligent human-AI collaboration systems.

### Research Areas

Our research centers on three core areas:

🧠 **Human-AI Cognitive Collaboration**  
We investigate the collaborative mechanisms between human cognitive processes and AI systems, exploring how to organically combine human creative thinking with machine computational power to achieve complementary intelligent decision-making and problem-solving.

💡 **Human-Computer Interaction**  
We design and develop innovative interaction paradigms and interface technologies to make communication between humans and intelligent systems more natural, intuitive, and efficient, enhancing user experience and interaction efficiency.

🔤 **Natural Language Understanding**  
We conduct in-depth research on semantic understanding, knowledge representation, and reasoning capabilities, developing intelligent systems that can understand and generate natural language to facilitate natural language communication between humans and machines.

These three directions mutually support and synergistically develop: deep natural language understanding provides more natural communication methods for human-computer interaction, advanced interaction technologies make human-AI cognitive collaboration more efficient, and cognitive collaboration research in turn guides and optimizes language understanding and interaction design.
