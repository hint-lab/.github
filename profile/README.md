# H!NT Lab

**H!NT Lab** (Human-Intelligence iNTegration Lab) is led by Dr. Hao Wang at the School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, China. The lab focuses on exploring cutting-edge technologies for the deep integration of human intelligence and machine intelligence, dedicated to building more natural, efficient, and intelligent human-AI collaboration systems.

### Research Areas

Our research centers on three core areas:

- 🧠 **Human-AI Cognitive Collaboration**  
- 💡 **Human-Computer Interaction**  
- 📄 **Natural Language Understanding**

These three directions mutually support and synergistically develop: deep natural language understanding provides more natural communication methods for human-computer interaction, advanced interaction technologies make human-AI cognitive collaboration more efficient, and cognitive collaboration research in turn guides and optimizes language understanding and interaction design.
